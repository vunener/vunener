/*
1) Create a database table named "modules", with these columns:
`code`, which is the primary key for storing unique 7-character module codes name,
`name`, which stores the names of the modules
`lecturer`, which stores the primary lecturers of the modules

2) Populate the database table with information of at least 3 modules.
You need to write PHP code to do the following:
    - Connect to the database using PDO.
    - Extract the data in the modules database table and present the data on the task page in the following formats:
- In a HTML table with appropriate column names.
- In a comma-separated format where each row in the database table is presented in a new line. For example:
  - code1,name1,lecturer1
  - code2,name2,lecturer2
  - code3,name3,lecturer3
